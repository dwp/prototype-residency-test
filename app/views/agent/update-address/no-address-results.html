    Follow these steps:

      <li>Check the format of any flat numbers - for example, Flat 2/2 may be known as Flat 4.</li>
      <li>Confirm the postcode and building number or name - if any are incorrect, <a href="/agent/update-address/update-address-1.html">search again</a>.</li>
      <li>If you have done the first 2 steps, and the address is still not listed, then you can <a href="/agent/update-address/update-address-manual-entry.html">enter the address manually</a>.</li>

      If the address you are looking for is not listed, you should check:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the postcode and building number or name are correct
        </li>
        <li>
          how any flat numbers are displayed, for example Flat 2/2 could also be known as Flat 4
        </li>
      </ul>
      If the customer's address is still not listed you can <a href="/agent/update-address/update-address-manual-entry.html">enter the customer's address details manually</a> instead, but this may make it more difficult to search for the address in future.
